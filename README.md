-->This game is similar to the classic snake game, we played on our nokia mobile devices.
-->The rules are similar except for some minor changes:
  1.You are allowed move over other parts of the snake's body.
  2.You are allowed to move in the direction opposite your current direction of movement
  3.If u hit the boundary wall u lose.
-->The rest of the rules are similar to the classic game.
-->Use the arrows keys to control the snake
